# Machine Learning Models

This repository contains machine learning models that I built while learning machine learning in the early stages of my journey (from January 2024). Each model is implemented using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn.

## Models

### 0. k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

### 1. Linear Regression

- Implementation of linear regression using scikit-learn.
- Evaluation of the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R^2).

### 2. Logistic Regression

- Implementation of logistic regression using scikit-learn.
- Evaluation of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### 3. Decision Trees

- Implementation of decision tree classifier and regressor using scikit-learn.
- Visualization of decision tree structure.

### 4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)

- Implementation of SVM classifier and regressor using scikit-learn.
- Evaluation of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Usage

Each model is implemented in a separate Python script.
To run a specific model, simply execute the corresponding script.

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib

Install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas matplotlib
