# Machine Learning Models

This repository contains machine learning models that I built while learning machine learning in the early stages of my journey (from January 2024). Each model is implemented using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn.

## Models

### 0. k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
- iris.ipynb
- 

### 1. Linear Regression
- biking (data = bikes.csv)
- 
   
### 2. Logistic Regression
- 
- 
 
### 3. Decision Trees
- 
- 

### 4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
-

## Usage
Each model is implemented in a separate Python script.
To run a specific model, simply execute the corresponding script.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib

Install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas matplotlib
